## There are all random problems i solved

#### There is the resolution of an annoying problem that I came across when I was using django's choices field

There was a project of mine in which the front end would be done with React and the back end with Django
so when I created a form in React in which there was an HTML select field, I always had to go and see how
I had declared the choices field in my model.

## get_choice_in_field_choices
